          My name is <i>John Brea McWhirter</i>. I am a passionate software and
          electrical engineer. I seek to learn and apply new technologies to
          advance the agricultural and oil industires improving efficiency,
          reducing cost and waste, and effectively work towards a more
          sustainable future.

          From an early age, I learned the rewards of hard work and persistence
          growing up in a farming family outside of the small town of Plains,
          TX. Ever since my feet were able to reach the pedals of an Old Ford
          Truck, I helped my family maintain over 1000 acres of farmland
          distributed throughout West Texas.

          I grew an interest in technology when my Dad decided to buy a
          satellite for our tractor. The new technology allowed the tractor to
          align itself using satellite imagery and maintain its course. Simply,
          it could drive itself! To a 12 year old kid, I was truly amazed and
          wanted to learn more about robotics. I attended Texas Tech's GEAR
          Robotics competition with a few of my peers and competed with other
          middle school students across the area.

          In High School, I grew my knowledge of STEM by competing in many UIL
          Mathematics events. In addition, growing up in a small town gave me
          the opportunity to participate in any extracurricular activity Plains
          ISD could offer. I lead our football, basketball, and golf teams as a
          Team Captain my Junior and Senior years. I earned the lead role in our
          school's One Act Play and lead our production to UIL Regional my
          Junior year and onto UIL State my senior year obtaining various
          All-Star Cast and Best Actor awards. All the while, I maintained a
          high GPA to earn Salutatorian and started my college courses through
          dual credit. I am grateful for all of the opportunities presented to
          me by High School and how it has affected my college and professional
          career.

          I started my college journey at South Plains College in Levelland, TX.
          Here I worked towards an Associate's in Pre-Engineering while I
          figured out what engineering focus I was most interested in. I sought
          leadership positions at the Baptist Student Ministry, SPC Campus
          Ambassadors, and as a Math Tutor for the Engineering Department. I was
          blessed to earn a trip to NASA Glenn Research Center through the NASA
          Community College Aerospace Scholars program. While there, I competed
          with a group of students from around the world attending a community
          college. Together, we designed a mock company and, under the
          restrictions of cost, built a robot which would complete various tasks
          on a course to earn a grant from NASA. In addition, I toured the Glenn
          Research Center and met a current intern who shared with me his
          passion for Computer Engineering and its many opportunities in every
          industry. Because of his inspiring testimony, I decided to visit Texas
          A&M University and consider their Computer Engineering program.

          I transferred from South Plains College to Blinn College after 3
          semesters in order to better align with Texas A&M's course
          equivalency. Unfortunately, COVID-19 hit while I was learning more
          about College Station and Texas A&M's diverse history. Despite this, I
          maintained my studies and successfully transferred to Texas A&M's
          Computer Engineering Department with a 4.0 GPA from South Plains
          College and Blinn College.

          Due to the lack of interaction during COVID-19, I was unable to pursue
          leadership programs at Texas A&M University. However, I sought a
          different role in the summer of 2021 as Ropes Counselor for a
          Christian camp in Estes Park, CO, called Camp Timberline. Through the
          summer I ministered the gospel to children from the ages of 6-18 and
          ensured their safety and fun use of the many Mountain Adventure
          equipment provided by Camp Timberline.

          With COVID-19 restriction finally receeding, I was blessed with the
          opportunity to join the Aggie Men's Club at Texas A&M University. AMC
          provided me with way to lead my fellow students in Texas A&M's core
          values, Respect, Excellence, Leadership, Loyalty, Integrity and
          Sefless service. Specifically, I volunteered through AMC for Big
          Event, AMC's Fall Festival, and a newer event called Maroon On The
          Green. Each of these provided me with a way to give back to my
          community and provide for those with less fortunate circumstances.

          In the summer of 2022, I earned an internship with Texas Instruments
          as an Application Enginerring Intern for the High Speed Converter
          Group. Here I collaborated with enthusiastic tehcnologists to provide
          support for High Speed Analog-to-Digital Converters and design a
          Python GUI Framework to provide a consistent and interactive way of
          testing Texas Instruments products. I'm thankful for the opporutnity
          to learn more about Signal Processing and how a language like Python
          can be used to provide industry with an interactive way of integrating
          TI's equipment with anything!
